This site is meant to be an opensource, text browser friendly, alternative to Cyberspace. 
For both aleviating high operating cost for genghis_khan and having the ability to be hosted from anywhere 
on anything. Think of it as a SHTF backup. Plus you can host any of your own html/php code here.
Just email me at gelocran@gmail.com. The exact direction of this project isn't anywhere near set in 
stone so feel free to give input. 

hosting this on your own is encouraged, just yeet all the files in your /var/www/html directory (or whatever one your OS uses) and make sure posts.txt is editable and ur good. fill in the rest with google.

Email me anything you want me to add or fork it.
Thanks.
