<h1>FreeSpace v0.01</h1>
<p>This site is meant to be an opensource, text browser friendly, alternative to Cyberspace. 
For both aleviating high operating cost for genghis_khan and having the ability to be hosted from anywhere 
on anything. Think of it as a SHTF backup. Plus you can host any of your own html/php code here.
Just email me at gelocran@gmail.com. The exact direction of this project isn't anywhere near set in 
stone so feel free to give input. 
In the meantime, check out this shitty game I made in 8th grade. (sry 4 level 3 being so hard)</p>
